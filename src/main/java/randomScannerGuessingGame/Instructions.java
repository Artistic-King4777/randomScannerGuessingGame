        TODO - ASSIGNMENT:

        Write a guessing game which prompts a user to guess a mystery number within some range such as 1 - 10

        After every guess the program should display some variation of "too large", "too small", "correct guess", respectively.

        Upon termination, the program should display the number of guesses before successfully guessing correctly.

        //TODO _ A number that is input consecutively, should register as a single guess.
        //TODO _ Didn't realize this part of the instructions

        TODO - SAMPLE OUTPUT:

        Pick a number between 1 and 10
         - 2
         - You guessed 2
         - Too big, guess again
         - 3
         - You guessed 3
         - Too big, guess again
         - 1
         - You guessed 1
         - You win!
         - The correct answer was 1
         - You guessed 2 time(s)
